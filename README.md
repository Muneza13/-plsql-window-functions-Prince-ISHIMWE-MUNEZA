## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Oracle SQL analytic/window functions** in the context of a **MUNEZA supplies LTD(Construction equipment seller company
)**. The analysis provides insights into top-selling products, customer segmentation, monthly growth, and sales trends to support business decisions.

*MUNEZA Supplies Ltd is a construction supply company that sells cement, steel bars, bricks, roofing sheets, paint, and other materials across different regions in RWANDA. The management wants to identify top-selling materials per region and quarter, monitor monthly revenue growth, segment customers by spend, and analyze sales trends to guide inventory and marketing decisions.*

## 🏢 Business Problem/challenge
MUNEZA supplies LTD faces critical challenges in:
- Optimizing inventory allocation across regional warehouses
- Understanding seasonal demand patterns for different construction materials
- Managing relationships with diverse customer segments (large contractors to individual builders)
- Predicting demand fluctuations between dry and rainy construction seasons
- Developing data-driven procurement and pricing strategies

## 📈 Results Analysis

* **Descriptive (What happened?)**
  Cement and steel bars consistently ranked as top sellers; Kigali and East regions contributed the highest revenue.
  

* **Diagnostic (Why?)**
  Large orders from top contractors in Kigali drove spikes in monthly totals. Seasonal demand in roofing and paint created fluctuations.

* **Prescriptive (What next?)**
  Maintain higher inventory of cement and steel; design loyalty promotions for quartile-2 customers to push them toward quartile-1.
