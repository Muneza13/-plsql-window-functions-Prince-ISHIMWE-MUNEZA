## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Oracle SQL analytic/window functions** in the context of a **MUNEZA supplies LTD (Construction equipment seller company)**.
The analysis provides insights into top-selling products, customer segmentation, monthly growth, and sales trends to support business decisions.

*MUNEZA Supplies Ltd is a construction supply company that sells cement, steel bars, bricks, roofing sheets, paint, and other materials across different regions in RWANDA. The management wants to identify top-selling materials per region and quarter, monitor monthly revenue growth, segment customers by spend, and analyze sales trends to guide inventory and marketing decisions.*

## üè¢ Business Problem/challenge

MUNEZA supplies LTD faces critical challenges in:

* Optimizing inventory allocation across regional warehouses
* Understanding seasonal demand patterns for different construction materials
* Managing relationships with diverse customer segments (large contractors to individual builders)
* Predicting demand fluctuations between dry and rainy construction seasons
* Developing data-driven procurement and pricing strategies

## üéØ Success Criteria

| **#** | **Success Criteria**                                  | **SQL Function(s)**                                 | **Business Use**                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Identify **Top 5 products per region per quarter**    | `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`                            | Know which construction materials are top sellers by region                  |
| 2     | Track **running monthly sales totals per region**     | `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)`        | Monitor cumulative revenue growth across months for each region              |
| 3     | Calculate **month-over-month (MoM) revenue growth %** | `LAG()`                                             | Detect sales growth/decline trends, plan stock & promotions                  |
| 4     | Segment **customers into quartiles by total spend**   | `NTILE(4)`                                          | Classify contractors (high spenders vs. low spenders) for marketing strategy |
| 5     | Compute **3-month moving average of product sales**   | `AVG() OVER (ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT)` | Smooth seasonal fluctuations & forecast demand                               |
